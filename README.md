# AdultwithMachinelearningModels
• This project aims to classify the status of the people based on their financial record in order to identify class of people from the given data.

• The algorithms used for this classification are Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are implemented using R programming and it's libraries.

• The code is not divided into number of files, it is present only in Adult_dataset.R file. The file  Adult_dataset.R contains main function, which invokes functions to train the model from scratch and then use the trained model to identify salary amount on the given input data. 

• A model trained using train and test function is saved and the final class analysis of the machine learning models are also stored. This file is used to restore the model state when new data is given as input to the model for classification.

• The details of SVM and Random Forest architecture including are given in the project report file. These models achieved an F1 score of 0.84 (84%) with SVM and 0.96 (96%) with Random Forest when evaluated using test dataset.
